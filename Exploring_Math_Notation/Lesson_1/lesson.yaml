  Output: In this lesson, we'll explore an experimental feature that allows you to display math notation.

- Class: math
  Output: "The formula for simple linear regression is $$E[Y_i] = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 X_i$$ If we add a second covariate, then it becomes $$E[Y_i] = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 X_{1i} + \\beta_2 X_{2i}$$ Press the button below when you are satisfied."
