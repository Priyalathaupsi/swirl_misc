- Class: figure
  Output: "The source file for this figure calls qplot twice to demonstrate that print() must be used to make a ggplot object appear. The first plot, not printed, won't appear. The second plot, using print, should."
  Figure: useqplot.R
  FigureType: new

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: "I believe that, except at top level, a ggplot2 object will not appear unless printed. To demonstrate that print is unnecessary at top level, type qplot(date, psavert, data=economics). (Type it precisely as I wrote it since I'm not allowing for variations.)"
  CorrectAnswer: qplot(date, psavert, data=economics)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='qplot(date, psavert, data=economics)')
  Hint: "Type qplot(date, psavert, data=economics). (Type it precisely as I wrote it since I'm not allowing for variations.)"
