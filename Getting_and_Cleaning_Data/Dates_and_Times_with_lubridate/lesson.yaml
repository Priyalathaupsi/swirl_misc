  Output: In this lesson, we'll explore the lubridate R package, by Garrett Grolemund and Hadley Wickham. According to the package authors, "lubridate has a consistent, memorable syntax, that makes working with dates fun instead of frustrating." If you've ever worked with dates in R, that statement probably has your attention.
