  Output: "I've created a variable called path2csv, which contains the full file path to the dataset we'll be using in this lesson. Call read.csv() with two arguments, path2csv and as.is = TRUE, and save the result in a new variable called cran. The first argument tells R where to find the dataset and the second argument tells R not to convert character variables to factors. Check ?read.csv if you need help."
  CorrectAnswer: cran <- read.csv(path2csv, as.is = TRUE)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='cran <- read.csv(path2csv, as.is = TRUE)')
  Hint: Store the result of read.csv(path2csv, as.is = TRUE) in a new variable called cran.
