  Course: Getting and Cleaning Data
  Lesson: Grouping and Chaining with dplyr
  Author: Nick Carchedi
  Type: Coursera
  Organization: JHU Biostat
  Version: 2.2.13

- Class: text
  Output: 'In the last lesson, you learned about the five main data manipulation ''verbs'' in dplyr: select(), filter(), arrange(), mutate(), and summarize(). The last of these, summarize(), is most powerful when applied to grouped data.'

- Class: text
  Output: The main idea behind grouping data is that you want to break up your dataset into groups of rows based on the value of some variable. The group_by() function is reponsible for doing this.

- Class: text
  Output: We'll continue where we left off with RStudio's CRAN download log from July 8, 2014, which contains information on roughly 225,000 R package downloads.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: As with the last lesson, the dplyr package was automatically installed (if necessary) and loaded at the beginning of this lesson. Normally, this is something you would have to do on your own. Just to build the habit, type library(dplyr) now to load the package again.
  CorrectAnswer: library(dplyr)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='library(dplyr)')
  Hint: Use library(dplyr) to load the dplyr package.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: I've made the dataset available to you in a data frame called mydf. Put it in a 'data frame tbl' using the tbl_df() function and store the result in a variable called cran. If you're not sure what I'm talking about, you should start with the previous lesson. Otherwise, practice makes perfect!
  CorrectAnswer: cran <- tbl_df(mydf)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='cran <- tbl_df(mydf)'); expr_creates_var('cran')
  Hint: Type cran <- tbl_df(mydf) to store the data in a new tbl_df called cran.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: To avoid confusion and keep things running smoothly, let's remove the original dataframe from your workspace with rm("mydf").
  CorrectAnswer: rm("mydf")
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='rm("mydf")')
  Hint: Use rm("mydf") to remove the original dataframe from your workspace.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Print cran to the console.
  CorrectAnswer: cran
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='cran')
  Hint: Type cran to print its contents.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Our first goal is to group the data by package name. Bring up the help file for group_by().
  CorrectAnswer: ?group_by
  AnswerTests: any_of_exprs('?group_by', 'help(group_by)')
  Hint: Use ?group_by to bring up the documentation.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Now group cran by the package variable and store the result in a new variable called by_package.
  CorrectAnswer: by_package <- group_by(cran, package)
  AnswerTests: omnitest('by_package <- group_by(cran, package)'); expr_creates_var('by_package')
  Hint: Store the result of group_by(cran, packages) in a new variable called by_package.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Let's take a look at by_package. Print it to the console.
  CorrectAnswer: by_package
  AnswerTests: any_of_exprs('by_package', 'print(by_package)')
  Hint: Type by_package to view its contents.

- Class: text
  Output: "At the top of the output above, you'll see 'Groups: package', which tells us that this tbl has been grouped by the package variable."

- Class: text
  Output: Recall that when we applied mean(size) to the original tbl_df via summarize(), it returned a single number -- the mean of all values in the size column. We may care about what that number is, but wouldn't it be so much more interesting to look at the mean download size for each unique package?

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: That's exactly what you'll get if you use summarize() to apply mean(size) to the grouped data in by_package. Give it a shot.
  CorrectAnswer: summarize(by_package, mean(size))
  AnswerTests: omnitest('summarize(by_package, mean(size))')
  Hint: 'Call summarize() with two arguments: by_package and mean(size).'

- Class: text
  Output: Instead of returning a single value, summarize() now returns the mean size for EACH package in our dataset.

- Class: script
  Output: "Let's take it a step further. I just opened an R script for you that contains a partially constructed call to summarize(). Follow the instructions in the script comments.\n\nYou may want to pull up the help files for n() and n_distinct()."
  AnswerTests: summarize1_test()
  Hint: Follow the directions in the script comments very carefully.
  Script: summarize1.R
