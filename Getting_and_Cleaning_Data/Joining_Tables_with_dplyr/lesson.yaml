  Author: Nick Carchedi
  Type: Coursera
  Organization: JHU Biostat
  Version: 2.2.15

- Class: text
  Output: "In previous lessons, you learned about the dplyr 'verbs' (i.e. functions) that work on a single table: select(), mutate(), arrange(), summarize(), filter(), and group_by()."

- Class: text
  Output: "dplyr also provides a set of four verbs that work on two tables at a time: inner_join(), left_join(), semi_join(), and anti_join(). These verbs come from the world of SQL, which is a language for working with relational databases. Each of them takes as arguments two separate tables and joins them together according to a different set of rules."

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: dplyr was automatically loaded for you when you started this lesson, but to build the habit, go ahead and (re)load the package now.
  CorrectAnswer: library(dplyr)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='library(dplyr)')
  Hint: library(dplyr) will (re)load the package.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Type ?join to bring up the documentation for the four join functions that we'll be exploring in this lesson.
  CorrectAnswer: ?join
  AnswerTests: gets_help('join')
  Hint: library(dplyr) will (re)load the package.

- Class: text
  Output: To illustrate how these join functions work, we'll use data from the nasaweather package. This package was automatically loaded for you at the beginning of this lesson.
