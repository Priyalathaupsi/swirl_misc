  Output: "In previous lessons, you learned about the dplyr 'verbs' (i.e. functions) that work on a single table: select(), mutate(), arrange(), summarize(), filter(), and group_by()."

  Output: "dplyr also provides a set of four verbs that work on two tables at a time: inner_join(), left_join(), semi_join(), and anti_join(). These verbs come from the world of SQL, which is a language for working with relational databases. Each of them takes as arguments two separate tables and joins them according to a different set of rules."
