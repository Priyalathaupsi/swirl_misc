- Class: text
  Output: In this lesson, you'll learn how to seamlessly combine dplyr and ggvis to manipulate data and create interactive plots. I'll assume you have some experience with dplyr's basic data manipulation verbs and the %>% operator for chaining commands together.

- Class: text
  Output: We'll be using data from the nycflights13 package, which was installed (if necessary) and loaded at the start of this lesson.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: The 'flights' dataset contains information on all flights that departed NYC in 2013. It has already been placed in a tbl_df for you. Type flights to preview it.
  CorrectAnswer: flights
  AnswerTests: any_of_exprs('flights', 'print(flights)')
  Hint: Type flights to preview the data.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: The 'weather' dataset contains hourly meteorological data from the same three airports cataloged in the flights data. This data has also been placed in a tbl_df. Type weather to preview it.
  CorrectAnswer: weather
  AnswerTests: any_of_exprs('weather', 'print(weather)')
  Hint: Type weather to preview the data.

- Class: script
  Output: Our first step is to summarize the flights data. I've opened an R script, where you'll find further instructions. You can play around in the console as much as you want, then type submit() when you are ready to proceed. If you get stuck, type reset() to start with a fresh script.
  AnswerTests: script_results_identical('daily')
  Hint: Read the directions in the script carefully. If R gave you an error, try to understand what it is telling you. Remember that if you get stuck, you can type reset() to start over.
  Script: script1.R

- Class: script
  Output: Next, we need to summarize the weather data. I've opened another script for you. Mess around in the console as much as you please, then type submit() when you are done, or type reset() to start over.
  AnswerTests: script_results_identical('daily_weather')
  Hint: Read the directions in the script carefully. If R gave you an error, try to understand what it is telling you. Remember that if you get stuck, you can type reset() to start over.
  Script: script2.R

- Class: script
  Output: Now, we're going to join the datasets. Complete the script, and type submit() when you're ready.
  AnswerTests: script_results_identical('daily_weather')
  Hint: Read the directions in the script carefully. If R gave you an error, try to understand what it is telling you. Remember that if you get stuck, you can type reset() to start over.
  Script: script3.R
