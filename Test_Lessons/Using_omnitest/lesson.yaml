  Output: 'This is a brief demonstration of function omnitest. Omnitest can grade
    student answers for a correct expression, a correct value, or both. In the case
    of values it is limited to testing for character or numerical vectors of length
    1. Omnitest''s general signature is: omnitest(correctExpr=NULL, correctVal=NULL,
    strict=FALSE)'

- Class: mult_question
  Output: 'First, I''ll use omnitest(correctVal=''Mamma Mia!'') for the answer to
    a multiple choice question: Which movie involves Pierce Brosnan in a singing role?'
  CorrectAnswer: Mamma Mia!
  AnswerChoices: Mamma Mia!;Guys and Dolls;Once is Not Enough
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='Mamma Mia!')
  Hint: In Guys and Dolls, Marlon Brando sings. In Once is Not Enough, 007 doesn't.

- Class: exact_question
  Output: 'Next, I''ll use omnitest(correctVal=3) for an exact numerical answer entered
    at the command line: How many Stooges are there?'
  CorrectAnswer: '3'
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal=3)
  Hint: This one should be obvious! Nyuk, Nyuk, Nyuk!

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: 'Now I''ll use omnitest(correctExpr=''scooby <- c(1969, 2013)'') to test
    that a user has entered a particular command: Enter scooby <- c(1969, 2013)'
  CorrectAnswer: scooby <- c(1969, 2013)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='scooby <- c(1969, 2013)')
  Hint: So far, Scooby has been on the air or in theaters from 1969 to 2013. Enter
    scooby <- c(1969, 2013)

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Omnitest has strict and casual modes. I'll demonstrate casual, the default,
    by using omnitest(correctExpr='3^2', correctVal=9) to test that a user has entered
    a command which computes a specific value but perhaps in a different manner than
    anticipated. The correct expression is 3^2, but enter 3*3.
  CorrectAnswer: 3^2
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='3^2', correctVal=9)
  Hint: Enter 3^2

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Finally, I'll demonstrate strict mode for same question, using omnitest(correctExpr='3^2',
    correctVal=9, strict=TRUE) to test that a user has entered a command which computes
    a specific value in a particular way. The correct expression is 3^2. Entering
    3*3 should fail.
  CorrectAnswer: 3^2
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='3^2', correctVal=9, strict=TRUE)
  Hint: Enter 3^2

  Output: That completes the omnitest test. Thank you.
