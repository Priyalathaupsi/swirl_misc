- Class: text
  Output: Hi, welcome to swirl! Today, I'm going to teach you how to create a new
    variable in R. Then I'll show you how to store some numbers in a vector and find
    the mean of those numbers.

- Class: text
  Output: 'To create a new variable in R, use the assignment operator, which looks
    like an arrow: <-.  For example, if you wanted to assign the value 10 to a new
    variable called x, you would type x <- 10.'

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Create a new variable that stores the value 20. You can call the variable
    anything you want as long as the name begins with a letter.
  AnswerTests: expr_is_a('<-'); expr_creates_var(); func_of_newvar_equals(20)
  CorrectAnswer: num <- 20
  Hint: Try num <- 20. Spaces don't matter, although it's good practice to include
    a space before and after the arrow.

- Class: text
  Output: The syntax for creating a vector of numbers, say 3, 4, and 5, is c(3,4,5).
    The c() function just 'concatenates', or joins, a group of numbers.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Try creating a vector of numbers using the c() function and store it in
    a variable of your choice.
  AnswerTests: expr_is_a('<-'); expr_creates_var(); expr_uses_func('c')
  CorrectAnswer: z <- c(6, 9, 10)
  Hint: If you wanted to create a variable z that stores the numbers 6, 9, and 10,
    you would type z <- c(6,9,10). Type ?c to view the help file for the c() function.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Now compute the mean of these numbers by calling the mean() function on
    your new vector. Don't worry about storing the result  in a variable.
  AnswerTests: expr_uses_func('mean'); func_of_newvar_equals( 'mean(newVar)')
  CorrectAnswer: mean(z)
  Hint: If you wanted to call the mean function on a variable y, you would type functionName(y).
    Type ?mean to view the help file for the mean() function.

- Class: mult_question
  Output: Which function in R computes the mean of a bunch of numbers?
  AnswerChoices: median(); mean(); average()
  AnswerTests: val_matches('mean()')
  Hint: This one should be obvious!

- Class: video
  Output: Would you like to view a brief YouTube video on how to compute the mean,
    median, and mode by hand?

- Class: text
  Output: Great work! Now you know how to create new variables and compute the mean
    of a bunch of numbers in R.
