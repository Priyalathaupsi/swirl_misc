  Output: Hi, welcome to swirl! Today, we're going to store some numbers in a vector,
    then take the mean of those numbers. I'm assuming you've already learned how to
    create variables and call functions.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: First, create a vector of numbers using the c() function and store that
    vector in a variable of your choice.
  AnswerTests: expr_is_a('<-'); expr_creates_var(); expr_uses_func('c')
  CorrectAnswer: newVar <- c(1:4)
  Hint: Type ?c to view the help file for the c() function.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Now compute the mean of these numbers by calling the mean() function on
    your new vector.
  AnswerTests: expr_uses_func('mean'); func_of_newvar_equals( 'mean(newVar)');testF()
  CorrectAnswer: mean(newVar)
  Hint: Type ?mean to view the help file for the mean() function.

- Class: mult_question
  Output: Which function in R computes the mean of a bunch of numbers?
  AnswerChoices: median(); mean(); average()
  AnswerTests: val_matches('mean()')
  Hint: This one should be obvious!

- Class: video
  Output: Would you like to view a brief YouTube video on how to compute the mean,
    median, and mode by hand?

  Output: Great work! Now you know how to compute the mean of a bunch of numbers in
    R.
